## About the author

Hello, my name is Kyle Paul (aka Baobao) and I am a student at Le Hong Phong High School for the Gifted in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I am passionate about coding, machine learning, and deep learning. I have completed many courses on these topics and have won many national-level and city-level prizes in this field. I am also a teaching assistant at one Python class and one Math for Machine Learning class. I graduated from Math AI class with GPA 9.2/10. I also do some research and write research papers under the instruction of my teachers. I have developed my own mathematical formula for machine learning, which I will share with you in this book.


## About the book
Welcome to "Intensive Machine Learning", a book that will teach you the fundamentals and applications of machine learning using both mathematics and coding practices. This book is the result of my two months of preparation and hard work. All content in this book is in English completely.

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is widely used in various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, self-driving cars, and more.

In this book, you will learn the more advanced concepts and techniques of machine learning, such as Nonlinear Predictor, MLP, Suppport Vector Machine, Recommder System, NLP, CNN, reinforcement learning, neural networks, and more. You will also learn how to implement these techniques using Python, a popular programming language for data science and machine learning.

This book is designed for learners who have some background in mathematics and programming, but want to deepen their understanding and skills in machine learning. The book is moderate between mathematics and coding practices, but the knowledge of math is burdensome enough for learners to learn in earnest. You will need to know some calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics to follow the mathematical derivations and proofs in this book. It also provides practical examples and exercises to help you apply what you learn to real-world scenarios. By reading this book, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of machine learning and its potential. You will also learn how to use popular machine learning libraries and frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Keras. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional, this book will help you master machine learning and become a confident machine learning practitioner.

By the end of this book, you will have a solid foundation in machine learning and be able to apply your knowledge and skills to real-world problems and projects. You will also be able to read and understand more advanced topics and research papers in machine learning.

I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it. I hope this book will inspire you to pursue your passion and curiosity in machine learning and artificial intelligence.


## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the Machine Learning Intensive book, you should:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `machine-learning-intensive/` directory
4. Run `jupyter-book clean machine-learning-intensive/` to remove any existing builds
5. Run `jupyter-book build machine-learning-intensive/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `machine-learning-intensive/_build/html/`.

### Hosting the book

Please see the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/web.html) to discover options for deploying a book online using services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify.

For GitHub and GitLab deployment specifically, the [cookiecutter-jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book) includes templates for, and information about, optional continuous integration (CI) workflow files to help easily and automatically deploy books online with GitHub or GitLab. For example, if you chose `github` for the `include_ci` cookiecutter option, your book template was created with a GitHub actions workflow file that, once pushed to GitHub, automatically renders and pushes your book to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo and hosts it on GitHub Pages when a push or pull request is made to the main branch.
