Hello, my name is Kyle Paul (aka Baobao) and I am a student at Le Hong Phong High School for the Gifted in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I am passionate about coding, machine learning, and deep learning. I have completed many courses on these topics and have won many national-level and city-level prizes in this field. I am also a teaching assistant at one Python class and one Math for Machine Learning class. I graduated from Math AI class with GPA 9.2/10 and Machine Learning class with 9.3/10. I also do some research and write research papers under the instruction of my teacher, who is also a researcher. I have developed my own mathematical formula for machine learning, which I will share with you in this book.


Welcome to "Intensive Machine Learning", a book that will teach you the fundamentals and applications of machine learning using both mathematics and coding practices. This book is the result of my two months of preparation and hard work, and it has been censored thoroughly by two counsellors: one is a machine learning engineer and one is a researcher/my teacher. All content in this book is in English completely.

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is widely used in various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, self-driving cars, and more.

In this book, you will learn the basic concepts and techniques of machine learning, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, linear regression, logistic regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, neural networks, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and more. You will also learn how to implement these techniques using Python, a popular programming language for data science and machine learning.

This book is designed for learners who have some background in mathematics and programming, but want to deepen their understanding and skills in machine learning. The book is moderate between mathematics and coding practices, but the knowledge of math is quite burden enough for learners to seriously learn. You will need to know some calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics to follow the mathematical derivations and proofs in this book. You will also need to know some Python basics to run the code examples and exercises in this book.

By the end of this book, you will have a solid foundation in machine learning and be able to apply your knowledge and skills to real-world problems and projects. You will also be able to read and understand more advanced topics and research papers in machine learning.

I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it. I hope this book will inspire you to pursue your passion and curiosity in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
